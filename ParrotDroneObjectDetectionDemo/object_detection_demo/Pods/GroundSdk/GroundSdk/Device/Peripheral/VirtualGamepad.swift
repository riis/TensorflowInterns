/// Virtual gamepad peripheral for `RemoteControl` devices.
///
/// Through this peripheral, you can receive navigation events when some predefined inputs are triggered on the remote
/// control.
///
/// The mapping between physical inputs (buttons, axes, etc.) on the device and received navigation events is specific
/// to the remote control in use: please refer to the remote control documentation for further information.
/// This peripheral is provided by all remote control devices, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the specific
/// remote control documentation.
///
/// To start receiving navigation events, the virtual gamepad peripheral must be grabbed and a listener (that will
/// receive all events) must be provided.
///
/// When the virtual gamepad is grabbed, the remote control will stop forwarding events associated to its navigation
/// inputs to the connected drone (if any) and instead forward those events to the application-provided listener.
/// To stop receiving events and having the device forward navigation input events back to the connected drone, the
/// virtual gamepad must be ungrabbed.
///
/// Most remote control devices also provide a more specialized gamepad interface (please refer to the remote control
/// documentation for further information), which usually allows to listen to finer-grained remote control input events.
/// However, when inputs are grabbed using such a specialized interface, the virtual gamepad is preempted, thus it
/// cannot be used anymore. While preempted, the navigation event won't be forwarded to the listener anymore, until all
/// inputs on the specialized gamepad interface are released.
/// At that point, the virtual gamepad will grab the navigation inputs again and resume forwarding events to the
/// application listener.
///
/// This peripheral is also in charge of notifying application events through the `NotificationCenter`.
/// Those events are the appAction* values defined in `ButtonsMappableAction` enum.
/// To subscribe to these notifications, please refer to the `GsdkActionGamepadAppAction` notification key
/// documentation.
///

/// ```
